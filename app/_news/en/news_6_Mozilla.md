Firefox editor Mozilla said they were "deeply conerned" about the French intelligence bill, joining [the myriad of voices speaking out against mass surveillance](https://ni-pigeons-ni-espions.fr/fr/#faq).

In a [press release published on April 22nd](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2015/04/22/mozilla-speaks-out-on-french-intelligence-bill/) the software company and open internet advocate's leadership said they were "particularly concerned about proposals to place so-called black boxes in the infrastructure of communications providers to conduct algorithmic surveillance", and "[urged] the French government to have a fully informed debate around this proposed bill".

After the French National Assembly voted the bill, Mozilla published another explicit release: [French National Assembly advances dangerous mass surveillance law](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2015/05/12/french-national-assembly-advances-dangerous-mass-surveillance-law/). They denounce a legislation that "threatens the integrity of Internet infrastructure, user privacy, and data security" and points out the "stark discrepancy between the open and constructive discussions being held in international fora and Franceâ€™s trajectory and disregard for the expressed concerns in these matters".
