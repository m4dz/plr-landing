title: I have nothing to hide, so I do not need to worry, do I?

Each and everyone of us has something to hide. That is why we have latches on the doors of our bathrooms, curtains at the windows of our bedrooms, and we do not want our employer to know we're sending our résumé elsewhere. None of these is illegal, and yet we need this privacy. Still not convinced? Send us your tax return, your last three payslips and  the password of your email account (we promise, we won't touch anything!) so we can speak about this topic. :)
