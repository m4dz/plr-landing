title: But won't black boxes only scan metadata?
---

Metadata are data about other data. In an email, they include the address of the sender, of the recipient, the type of document, its size, and the time it was sent. This information, once structured, are easily  processed by a computer, a lot more easily than unstructured data like a  voice message or a picture. It's therefore very easy for a computer to  cross-reference metadata to understand what a person is doing. As an example, let's consider a series of phone calls of which we only know  the metadata. A person receives a call from an AIDS screening lab. The  following call is to a doctor, plus three additional people, from which  only one was previously contacted recently, and finally to a support  helpline. We know nothing about the content of these conversations, but  we can easily guess what happened.

It is naive to state that metadata can be anonymized, particularly in the context of globally cross-referenced data.
