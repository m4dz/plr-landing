The bill went through the National Assembly with hardly any debate. MPs adopted the whole surveillance package without any substantial amendment. What these debates highlighted is the discomfort of the French government when asked tough questions by the rare but brave opponents to the bill in Parliament. 

NiPigeonsNiEspions showed leverage during this first stage: the government called an emergency meeting with hosting providers, President Fran√ßois Hollande announced he would himself submit the law to the Constitutional Council... It's only the beginning!

On May 5th - next Tuesday - the French National Assembly will formally vote the bill before transferring it to the Senate. This will ring the end of the first round but the game is not over; let's get together and keep on fighting!
